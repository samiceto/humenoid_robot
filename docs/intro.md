# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: From Simulated Brains to Walking Bodies" - a comprehensive textbook for advanced undergraduate and Master's students, industry engineers, and university instructors.

## About This Book

This book provides a complete educational package for learning the modern embodied AI stack, taking you from zero robotics experience to deploying voice-controlled autonomous humanoid systems. You'll learn the complete development lifecycle from simulation to deployment using industry-standard tools.

## Target Audience

- Advanced undergraduate / Master's students in robotics, AI, and embodied intelligence
- Industry engineers transitioning into humanoid robotics
- University instructors who will adopt the book as primary course text

## Technology Stack

Throughout this book, you'll work with the modern 2025-2027 supported technology stack:

- **ROS 2**: Iron Irwini / Jazzy Jalisco
- **Simulation**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim 2024.2+
- **Perception**: Isaac ROS 3.0+
- **Navigation**: Nav2
- **Hardware**: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, RTX 4070 Ti+, Jetson Orin platforms

## How to Use This Book

This book follows a sim-to-real approach, where you'll first learn concepts in simulation before deploying to real hardware. Each chapter includes:

- Theoretical foundations
- Practical implementation examples
- Hands-on exercises
- Performance benchmarks
- Safety considerations

## Hardware Requirements

For the complete learning experience, you'll need:

- **Development**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, RTX 4070 Ti or equivalent
- **Edge Deployment**: Jetson Orin Nano 8GB or higher
- **Optional Real Robot**: Unitree G1 or equivalent platform

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to set up your development environment, then progress through each part systematically. The book is designed to build complexity gradually, ensuring you master foundational concepts before advancing to sophisticated applications.
